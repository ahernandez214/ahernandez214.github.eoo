# Objective 

- What is the key pain point? 

JJ Olatunji wants to determine which of his three YouTube channels—KSI, Sidemen, or JJ Olatunji—would be the most effective for promoting the England jersey for the 2025 World Cup. He needs data-driven insights to decide which channel will generate the highest engagement and visibility for the campaign.


- What is the ideal solution? 

To create a dashboard that provides insights into the performance of JJ Olatunji’s three channels, including:
- subscriber count
- total views
- total videos, and
- engagement metrics

This dashboard will help JJ and his team decide which channel to use for the England jersey promotion and future marketing campaigns.

## User story 

As JJ Olatunji, I want to use a dashboard to analyze my three YouTube channels (KSI, Sidemen, and JJ Olatunji) and determine which has the highest engagement and reach.

This dashboard should allow me to compare performance metrics such as subscriber growth, average views, and audience interaction to ensure that I choose the most effective channel for promoting the England jersey for the 2025 World Cup.

With this information, I can maximize campaign effectiveness and ensure the highest possible impact and engagement from my audience.


# Data source 

- What data is needed to achieve our objective?

We need data on the top UK YouTubers in 2024 including their 
- channel names
- total subscribers
- total views
- total videos uploaded



- Where is the data coming from? 
The data is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract), [see here to find it.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-100-social-media-influencers-2024-countrywise?resource=download)


# Stages

- Design
- Developement
- Testing
- Analysis 
 


# Design 

## Dashboard components required 
- What should the dashboard contain based on the requirements provided?

To understand what it should contain, we need to figure out what questions we need the dashboard to answer:

1. Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
2. Which of JJ's 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?
3. Which of JJ's 3 channels have the most views?
4. Which of JJ's 3 channels have the highest average views per video?
5. Which of JJ's 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
6. Which of JJ's 3 channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?

For now, these are some of the questions we need to answer, this may change as we progress down our analysis. 


## Dashboard mockup

- What should it look like? 

Some of the data visuals that may be appropriate in answering our questions include:

1. Table
2. Treemap
3. Scorecards
4. Horizontal bar chart

## Tools 


| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Excel | Exploring the data |
| SQL Server | Cleaning, testing, and analyzing the data |
| Power BI | Visualizing the data via interactive dashboards |
| GitHub | Hosting the project documentation and version control |
| Mokkup AI | Designing the wireframe/mockup of the dashboard | 


# Development

## Pseudocode

- What's the general approach in creating this solution from start to finish?

1. Get the data
2. Explore the data in Excel
3. Load the data into SQL Server
4. Clean the data with SQL
5. Test the data with SQL
6. Visualize the data in Power BI
7. Generate the findings based on the insights
8. Write the documentation + commentary
9. Publish the data to GitHub Pages

## Data exploration notes

This is the stage where you have a scan of what's in the data, errors, inconsistencies, bugs, weird and corrupted characters etc  


- What are your initial observations with this dataset? What's caught your attention so far? 

1. There are at least 4 columns that contain the data we need for this analysis, which signals we have everything we need from the file without needing to contact the client for any more data. 
2. The first column contains the channel ID and what appears to be channel IDS, separated by an @ symbol—we need to extract the channel names from this.
3. Some of the cells and header names are in a different language - we need to confirm if these columns are needed, and if so, we need to address them.
4. We have more data than we need, so some of these columns would need to be removed





## Data cleaning 
- What do we expect the clean data to look like? (What should it contain? What contraints should we apply to it?)

The aim is to refine our dataset to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis. 

The cleaned data should meet the following criteria and constraints:

- Only relevant columns should be retained.
- All data types should be appropriate for the contents of each column.
- No column should contain null values, indicating complete data for all records.

Below is a table outlining the constraints on our cleaned dataset:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Number of Rows | 100 |
| Number of Columns | 4 |

Here is a tabular representation of the expected schema for the clean data:

| Column Name | Data Type | Nullable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_name | VARCHAR | NO |
| total_subscribers | INTEGER | NO |
| total_views | INTEGER | NO |
| total_videos | INTEGER | NO |



- What steps are needed to clean and shape the data into the desired format?

1. Remove unnecessary columns by only selecting the ones you need
2. Extract YouTube channel names from the first column
3. Rename columns using aliases







### Transform the data 



```SQL
/*
# 1. Select the required columns
# 2. Extract the channel name from the 'NOMBRE' column
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS channel_name,  -- 2.
    total_subscribers,
    total_views,
    total_videos

FROM
    top_uk_youtubers_2024
```


### Create the SQL view 

```SQL
/*
# 1. Create a view to store the transformed data
# 2. Cast the extracted channel name as VARCHAR(100)
# 3. Select the required columns from the top_uk_youtubers_2024 SQL table 
*/

-- 1.
CREATE VIEW view_uk_youtubers_2024 AS

-- 2.
SELECT
    CAST(SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS VARCHAR(100)) AS channel_name, -- 2. 
    total_subscribers,
    total_views,
    total_videos

-- 3.
FROM
    top_uk_youtubers_2024

```


# Testing 

- What data quality and validation checks are you going to create?

Here are the data quality tests conducted:

## Row count check
```SQL
/*
# Count the total number of records (or rows) in the SQL view
*/

SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS no_of_rows
FROM
    view_uk_youtubers_2024;

```

![Row count check](assets/images/1_row_count_check.png)



## Column count check
### SQL query 
```SQL
/*
# Count the total number of columns (or fields) in the SQL view
*/


SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS column_count
FROM
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE
    TABLE_NAME = 'view_uk_youtubers_2024'
```
### Output 
![Column count check](assets/images/2_column_count_check.png)



## Data type check
### SQL query 
```SQL
/*
# Check the data types of each column from the view by checking the INFORMATION SCHEMA view
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    COLUMN_NAME,
    DATA_TYPE
FROM
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE
    TABLE_NAME = 'view_uk_youtubers_2024';
```
### Output
![Data type check](assets/images/3_data_type_check.png)


## Duplicate count check
### SQL query 
```sql
/*
# 1. Check for duplicate rows in the view
# 2. Group by the channel name
# 3. Filter for groups with more than one row
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    channel_name,
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM
    view_uk_youtubers_2024

-- 2.
GROUP BY
    channel_name

-- 3.
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;
```
### Output
